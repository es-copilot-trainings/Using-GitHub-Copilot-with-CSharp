# GitHub ♥️ .NET

Want to try out the latest performance improvements coming with .NET for web development? 

This repo builds a Weather API, OpenAPI integration to test with [Scalar](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/openapi/using-openapi-documents?view=aspnetcore-9.0#use-scalar-for-interactive-api-documentation), and displays the data in a web application using Blazor with .NET. 

We've given you both a frontend and backend to play around with and where you go from here is up to you!

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following tools and versions installed:

- **.NET 9.0 SDK** - This application targets .NET 9.0
  - Download from: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
  - Verify installation: `dotnet --version` (should show 9.0.x or higher)

### Run Options
 
1. Clone the repo to your local machine `git clone https://github.com/es-copilot-trainings/dotnet-copilot`
2. Open repo in VS Code

## Getting started

1. **▶️ Run all, one-click**: Use VS Code's built-in *Run* command and open the forwarded ports *8080* and *8081* in your browser.
